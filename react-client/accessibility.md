# Accessibility questions

### Were React’s compilation warning/error messages helpful?

Very helpful. Most of the things that it caught were able to be debugged on stack overflow. New issues that react bring include lots of component updates (which were not encountered in the prior homework assignments). But, again, there are a lot of resources online to work through this.

### Did React’s compilation warning/error messages prompt you to consider making your site more accessible?

They did not actually. Most of the errors warned of unused variables, and compilation errors. Prompting for accessability was not encountered.

### Did you consider conducting accessibility testing on your lab assignment? Why or why not?

I am actually a fan of running the Lighthouse suite of tests, which has a section on accessability (the chrome extension that we used for prior accessability reports was a little overkill and hard to use for me). It adds to the entire experience (keyboard navigation I actually find useful, even though I use a keyboard and mouse), so yes, we thought about this. 

### If you tested your site for accessibility and found issues, were you able to solve them? What did you do to try to solve them? What stopped you from successfully resolving or trying to resolve the issues?

Although the Lighthouse score found some accessibility enhancements, we did not go through great lengths to fix them, just because they took things away from the scope of the assignment. If we had more time and there was more weight on it, we would go through more to fix them (although the things that are added already are pretty good).
